# 1. Introduction

This exercise aims to plot interactive population pyramids on a planning area level from year 2000-2010.

Import the packages needed.

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse','readxl','dplyr','ggplot2','plotly','gganimate','ggiraph')
for(p in packages){
 if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
  install.packages(p)
 }
 library(p,character.only = T)
 }
```
## 1.1. Sketch 

Below is a sketch of the population pyramids by planning areas.

# 2. Data Exploration and preparation

Import both population data
The data is imported using read_csv() function of **readr** package.
It can be observed that both datasets have same columns, hence, can be combined.

```{r}
data0010 <- read_csv("respopagesextod2000to2010/respopagesextod2000to2010.csv")
data1120 <- read_csv("respopagesextod2011to2020/respopagesextod2011to2020.csv")
```

As the analysis aims to analyse the change of population over the years from 2000 to 2020, the two datasets are combined using **rbind()**.

```{r}
data <- rbind(data0010, data1120)
```

Group population by planning area and plot a Pareto chart to inspect the population distribution over planning area.
User can check the value by moving mouse over to bars or points.

It can be observed from the interactive bar chart that some planning areas are having 0 population.
It can also be observed that more than 50% of the population comes from the top 9 planning areas ordered by total population count.
The focus will be on these 9 planning areas.

```{r}
data_grouped_pa <- data %>%
  group_by(PA)%>%
  summarise(
    count_by_pa = sum(Pop, na.rm = TRUE)) 

#order the data and add the cumulative percentage column
data_grouped_pa <- data_grouped_pa[order(data_grouped_pa$count_by_pa, decreasing=TRUE),]

data_grouped_pa$cumulative <- cumsum(data_grouped_pa$count_by_pa)/sum(data_grouped_pa$count_by_pa) * 100

#create the scale on secondary y-axis
scale <- tail(data_grouped_pa$cumulative, n=1)/head(data_grouped_pa$count_by_pa, n=1)


p <- ggplot(data_grouped_pa,
            aes(x = reorder(PA, -count_by_pa),y = count_by_pa,  
                 tooltip=count_by_pa)) +
  geom_bar_interactive(stat = "identity", color="black", fill = 'light blue') + 
  geom_path_interactive(aes(y=cumulative/scale, group=1),colour="red", size=0.9) +
  geom_point_interactive(aes(y=cumulative/scale, group=1,tooltip = cumulative),colour="red") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    # Features of the first y-axis
    name = "Population Count",
    # Add second y-axis and specify its features
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ .*scale, name="% of Total Running Sum of Population Count")
  ) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + 
  labs(title="Pareto Chart", subtitle="Count of Population by planning area",     
       x="Planning Area", y=expression(count_by_pa(~mu~Ah/~mu~s)))


girafe(ggobj = p,width_svg = 7,
       height_svg = 6)
```

Filter the data for the top 9 planning areas with the most population amount.

```{r}
filter_list <- data_grouped_pa$PA[1:9]
print(filter_list)
data_filtered <- filter(data, PA %in% filter_list)

data_filtered$PopPercent <- data_filtered$Pop/sum(data_filtered$Pop) * 100
```

# 3. Plot the population pyramid for the 9 planning areas
Tooltip will display information about population count, age group, year and gender     when the mouse is over a bar.
At the bottom of the chart, user can click play to see the evolution of population 
for each planning area over the years.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = AG, fill = Sex,
                 y = ifelse(test = Sex == "Males", yes = -Pop, no = Pop),frame = 
                    Time,text = paste0("Population:", Pop,"\n",
                                       "Age group:",AG,"\n",
                                       "Year:", Time,"\n",
                                       "Gender:", Sex)))+
  geom_col(position = "identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = abs, limits = max(data_filtered$Pop) * c(-1,1)) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=data_filtered$AG)+
  labs(title = "Population Pyramids", x = "Age", y = "Population Count") +
  coord_flip() + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  facet_wrap(~PA) 
  
ggplotly(p,tooltip = "text",autosize = FALSE,width = 700, height = 900)
``` 

# 4. Challenges

Subplots of population pyramid are squeezed together, making it unclear to read as the axis labels overlapped each other. The main challenge is to find ways to resize the plot.
layout() is used for the resizing, with autosize = FALSE, width = 700 and height = 900
