# 1. Data Visualization Critique

The "Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex" file provides labor force
participation rate(LFPR) at different age groups from year 1991-2021.

The intended visualization aims to show LFPR by age group for each year from year 2010-2021.
The original design as shown below has clarify and aesthetic issues which will be discussed 
in the next section.

![original_design](original_design.png){width=80%}

## 1.1. Critiques: Clarity

**(a) Misleading labeling of bottom x-axis. and formatting of both x-axis and y-axis:**

The label on the bottom x axis is misleading as it only shows 2015. As the graph needs to show LFPR from year 2010-2021 for each age group, this information should be easily identified by the user. As an improvement, a bar graph can be used to represent the LFPR value for each year under each age group. In this case, one color corresponds to a year, and user can identify the LFPR value for each year by referring to the legend.       

**(b) Improper labeling of upper x-axis and y-axis:**

The first two labels "75 &O.." and "70& Ov.." for Age-group are not shown entirely,it would be better to flip the direction of label so that all labels for age group can be seen properly.

On the y-axis, the 'Lfpr' should be all capital letters. And it is not clear to the user what unit the axis is in. It would be better if the unit '%' can be shown.

**(b) Improper visualization header:**

The title does not tell user clearly for what category the LFPR is shown for. It would be better if the title can mention that the LFPR is for each year from 2010-2021 of each age group.

Also, as 'LFPR' label of the y-axis is a short form for 'Labour force participation rate', it would be better to include it in a bracket beside the title so that user knows its meaning.

There is no subtitle, having a subtitle explaining the key observations from the graph can make it easier for user to understand the visualization.

**(d) Redundant sorting of age groups according to LFPR**

The age groups are sorted according to LFPR in an ascending order. This is redundant as the user may need to identify LFPR trends for people in working age or for elderly.

For example, in Singapore the typical ages for economic activity can be in the interval of 20-65, and the ages for elderly persons are from 65 years and over as referenced from page 2 of the website with [link](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/standards_and_classifications/nsa.pdf). 

Therefore, displaying the age group in its original order would be better for user to identify the population of interest for analysis. To compare across age groups, statistics such as average LFPR, percentage change in LFPR for each year and overall percentage change from 2010-2021 can be added in.

## 1.2. Critiques: Aesthetics

**(a) Redundant grid lines:**

The shallow grid lines within each age group are redundant as it does not help in the visualization of any categorization of data and may be confusing to user when looking at it. Hence, it can be removed.

**(b) Redundant color for each age group:**

As each categorization of age group can be identified from the 'Age-group' axis label, is it redundant to assign different colors to different age groups and stated it in the legend. Also, assigning color to each age group does not help user to identify yearly change of LFPR. Hence, color should be used to differentiate years within each age group, and the legend can be changed to indicate the color corresponding to each color.

**(c) Title does not stand out:**

Title is not in bold, it will be better to format title as bold.

# 2. Sketch of Proposed Design

Below shows a sketch of the proposed design.

![](sketch.jpg){width=50%}

The proposed design will consist of bar graph for each year from 2010-2021 under each age group. The legend displays the color corresponding to each year. In this way, user can inspect the years as a whole, or only individual years according to color.

An additional section displaying the percentage change of LFPR from previous year is added, this helps user to understand the degree of fluctuation in LFPR for each age group.

To show the overall change from 2010-2021, another graph is created to display the % change, with red color indicating positive % change and blue color indicating negative % change, to give user an idea of the overall trend.

# 3. Data Visualization

## 3.1. Data Preparation

**Step 1:**

The data is downloaded from Ministry of Manpower website [link](https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/LabourForceTimeSeries.aspx) titled 'Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex'.

![](excel_image1.png){width=50%}

Under sheet 'mrsd_Res_LFPR_2', the data for each age group from year 1991 to 2021 is available.

-The visualization is only going to focus on total.

-As the visualization only focuses on LFPR per age group, the row 'Total' can be deleted. 

-Also,the row '70 & over' can be deleted as it can be separated into '70 to 74' and '75 & Over' and just retaining the later two rows are enough. 

-The columns containing data for year 1991-2009 are deleted as the visualization only focuses on year 2010-2021. 

After applying the above changes, create a separate sheet named 'Total' to store the data as shown below:

![](excel_total.png){width=50%}

### Import data into Tableau

**Step 1:** 

Import sheet 'Total' into Tableau

![](data_tableau1.png){width=50%}

**Step 2:** 

Click on 'Use Data Interpreter' to clean the data.
The columns are now with proper header 'Age (Years)/Sex' and years from 2010-2021.

![](data2_tableau.png){width=50%}

**Step 3:**

Change column name 'Age (Years)/Sex' to 'Age group' by clicking on the 'rename' option and making the corresponding change.

![](data3_tableau.png){width=50%}

**Step 4:**

Select all columns from 2010-2021, right click and select 'pivot':

![](data4_tableau.png){width=50%}

In the resulting table, change the column name 'Pivot Field Names' to 'Years' and 'Pivot Field Values' to 'LFPR(%)'.

### 3.2.4. Create dashboard
  
  -Drag 'graph1-2' and 'graph3' onto the dashboard.
  
  -Under 'Dashboard', set the 'Size' to 1000x600.
  
  ![](d1.png){width=20%}
  
  -Place 'graph3' at the bottom, adjust its size and align its vertical 
   grid lines with 'graph1-2'.
  
  -Rename the dashboard as 'LFPR'
  
  The dashboard is now completed:
  
  ![](final.png){width=90%}


# 4. Main Observations

**1.** It can be observed that age groups having high LFPR are from 25-54. Each age group within this range has average LFPR above        80% over the year 2010-2021. 

**2.** The age groups mentioned in point 1 also has low % change in yearly LFPR as shown by the low bar heights in the second 
       graph. The overall change from 2010 to 2021 is also low, with highest percentage change of 6.20%. 

Point 1 together with point 2 indicates that LFPR for working age within 25-54 is high over the years and the values are relatively stable too, suggesting stable increase in workforce population over the years.
       
 ![](ob1.png){width=50%}


**3.**  Age groups for elderly, 65-69, 70-74 and 70 & over, are having increasing trend in LFPR over the years as observed through        the increasing bar height for LFPR over 2010-2021. 
       This corresponds to the second graph too, as most of the bars are of positive value, indicating an   
       increasing trend. Apart from positive bar values, the bar heights showing % changes are higher than age groups within range        of 25-54, suggesting higher fluctuations. 
       This corresponds to the percentage change values shown by the third graph, with 20% and 30.10% increase for age groups  
       65-69 and 70-74, and 6.40% increase for age group 70 & Over. 
       This indicates that more and more elderly are participating in work, creating more labor force for Singapore as a result.
       
 ![](ob2.png){width=50%}
       
**4.** Looking at the third graph, LFPR for all age groups except 20-24 are increasing. This may be because 
       of reasons such as more and more people pursuing higher education after graduation as indicated by the increasing number of        graduates from higher degree courses [link](https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M850551). 
       However, it may of interest to user of the data to explore further the reasons behind it.
