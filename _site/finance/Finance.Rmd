  3. Financial Analysis
  
    I'm in charge of financial analysis and will describe the slides made for the 
    presentation as shown below.

**Financial Analysis**

Financial statement information from year 2017-2020 are collected from eastmoney app 
as well as annual reports that can be found and downloaded from website:
http://www.cninfo.com.cn/new/index

Information are collected and calculated using excel, graphs are then plotted
using Tableau for easier viewing.

Overall, both company presents healthy financial statements,indicating high growth potential.

**1. Asset**

  + Looking at asset information gives us an idea of the company size and growth potential.
     + Bars representing the absolute value of asset in billion and percentage shows the 
       % growth from previous year.
     + CATL is much larger in company size than EVE.
     + Both companies show positive growth rate over the year.
     + Growth rate is increasing in general, indicating high growth potential.

**2. Liability**

  + Looking at liability information to understand if the company has insolvency risk.
     + Liabilities 1
       + Total Liabilities: 
         + CATL has higher liability than EVE, this is not suprising considering its much larger 
            asset volume.
       + Liability-Asset ratio:
         + Both companies has a positive ratio in a healthy range of 35%-65%.
       + Current ratio:
         + Both companies has a positive ratio >1.

       ![](liabilities1.png){width=60%} 
   + Liabilities 2
     + Cash and cash equivalents & cash/total assets
       + Both companies have positive cash, with CATL having higher % of assets in cash,
        indicating higher debt-paying ability.
     + Cash and cash equivalents - interest bearing liabilities
       + Same as above, with higher value, CATL has lower default risk.

**3. Product**
   
   + Price Negotiation Power
     + Difference
       + Difference = (Accounts payable + Advanced Payment Received)  - (Accounts Receivable + Advanced Payment)
       + Positive value suggests that the company's product is competitive, giving it a higher price negotiation power
       + CATL has a much larger positive value than EVE, this makes sense as it is the leading company in the industry.
     + Accounts Receivable/Total Asset
       + This percentage should not be very high as a high value means that the company may have difficulty selling
         its product, suggesting lower product competitiveness.
       + The percentage for both company are low, below 20%.
       + EVE has a higher percentage, indicating lower product competitiveness.
       
       ![](price_negotiation.png){width=60%}  

   + Profit margin and cost management
      + Gross Profit Margin
        + CATL's gross profit margin is slowly decreasing over the year while
          EVE has slightly increasing value from 2018 onwards.
        + EVE's value is higher than CATL from 2019 onwards.
      + Costs(%)
        + Cost of research, sales and management / Total Revenue * 100%
        + Lower percentage value means better cost ability.
        + Both companies have low percentages that are slowly decreasing over the years.

**4. Net Profit**

   + Profit for parent company's owners
      + Net Profit
        + Both companies have positive increasing values from 2018 onwards.
        + The values for CATL is much higher than EVE.

**5. Other Ratios**

   + P/E
     + The high values indicate that both companies are overvalued.
   + ROE
     + EVE has higher ROE than CATL from 2018 onwards, this is a bit suprising given CATL's better
       performance in other areas.
